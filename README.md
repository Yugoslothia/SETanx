# SETanx

To access Iteration 3's finals, you must go to FinalBuild/absoluteFinal and there is all of the code we have ready for Iteration 3.
All other code is either testing or left over scraps from implementation and testing. Everything in the absoluteFinal directory is the
code we would use if we were to push this game out as a product to a consumer. 

We hope you have as much fun looking at and playing the game as we did working together and creating it!
